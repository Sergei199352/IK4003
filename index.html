    <p>This privacy policy describes how our mobile application, 4003 (hereafter "App"), collects, handles, and uses the information gathered from users. The App connects to a 4003 device via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and is designed to collect data regarding device configurations, ambient magnetic fields, and other events detected by the device.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The App collects the following information from the connected 4003 device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device configurations</li>
        <li>Ambient magnetic field measurements</li>
        <li>Event data collected by the device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal information is collected from the users. All data collected is strictly related to the device and its environment.</p>

    <h2>Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>The App requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>File writing access: Necessary for saving data onto your device's storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Storage of Information</h2>
